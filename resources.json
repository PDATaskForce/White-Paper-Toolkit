    "description": "This MIT Sloan article summarises research by Isabella Loaiza and Roberto Rigobon, which introduces the EPOCH framework – Empathy & emotional intelligence, Presence & connectedness, Opinion/judgment & ethics, Creativity & imagination, and Hope & vision – to identify human capabilities that complement AI. Using O*NET task data, the authors find that tasks relying on these human capabilities are less likely to be automated and correlate with employment growth, whereas tasks with high automation or augmentation risk are associated with job losses【288162455168511†L108-L129】【288162455168511†L176-L183】. The article emphasises that AI struggles with subjective beliefs and creativity, so organisations should design AI strategies that augment and upskill workers rather than replace them【288162455168511†L60-L69】【288162455168511†L176-L200】.",

    "description": "Gartner’s 2025 technology trends report highlights agentic AI – goal‑driven software entities that autonomously plan and act using memory, planning and tooling. Agentic AI will integrate into assistants, SaaS platforms and IoT devices and is expected to appear in 33% of enterprise applications and 20% of digital storefront interactions by 2028【476239108818402†L42-L50】【476239108818402†L104-L119】. The report notes that agentic AI offers significant productivity gains but poses risks: unknown bots and low‑code agents may proliferate, poor data quality and architecture hinder development, security threats such as smart malware and prompt injection become more severe, and employees may resent autonomous systems【476239108818402†L288-L326】.
